## 📦 Download

Head over to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Arifmaulanaazis/Gromacs-Prebuild-Windows/releases) section to download the latest prebuilt binaries.

> ⚠️ Make sure to download the correct archive for your system.

## 📁 Included Files

The prebuilt archive is organized as follows:

```
gmx/
├── GMXRC.bat                   # Environment loader for Windows
├── bin/
│   ├── gmx.exe                 # Main GROMACS executable
│   ├── cufft64_11.dll          # CUDA FFT runtime
│   ├── libfftw3f-3.dll         # FFTW runtime
│   └── [other helper files, scripts, and autocompletion files]
├── include/
│   └── gromacs/               # Header files for development
├── lib/

│       └── README.tutor       # Tutorial and additional documentation
```

## ⚙️ Quick Start

1. **Extract** the downloaded archive to your desired location.
2. **Activate** the GROMACS environment:
   - Double-click `GMXRC.bat` from the `gmx` folder.
   - This script automatically adds the `bin/` directory to your session `PATH`.
3. **Test** the installation by opening a new Command Prompt and executing:
   ```bash
   gmx -v
   ```
   You should see version information along with details about CUDA and GPU support.

## 🚀 Running GROMACS with GPU Acceleration

After setting up the environment, you can run your simulations as usual. For example, to start a molecular dynamics run:

```bash
gmx mdrun -s topol.tpr
```

Or to verify GPU support, use:
```bash
gmx mdrun -v -nb gpu
```

Check the output for confirmation of CUDA support and active GPU acceleration.

## 📌 Additional Notes

- **Driver Requirements:** Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed that are compatible with CUDA 12.1.
- **Environment Setup:** The `GMXRC.bat` file sets the necessary `PATH` for the current session. For permanent configuration, consider adding the `bin/` directory to your system `PATH`.
